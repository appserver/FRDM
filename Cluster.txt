Cluster Policy and Local Policy

There are two levels of authorization policy:

Cluster policy
	

Roles and bindings that are applicable across all projects. Roles that exist in the cluster policy are considered cluster roles. Cluster bindings can only reference cluster roles.

Local policy
	

Roles and bindings that are scoped to a given project. Roles that exist only in a local policy are considered local roles. Local bindings can reference both cluster and local roles.

This two-level hierarchy allows re-usability over multiple projects through the cluster policy while allowing customization inside of individual projects through local policies.

During evaluation, both the cluster bindings and the local bindings are used. For example:

    Cluster-wide "allow" rules are checked.

    Locally-bound "allow" rules are checked.

    Deny by default.
